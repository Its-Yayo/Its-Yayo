Helloooooooo, I´m Yayo, or Luis Fer, you can call me as you want tho, actually almost everyone calls me Yayo but emmm, anyways. I´m a IT guy, but actually a  TEC student, currently studying Computer Engineering and Cybersecurity, focusing on Pentesting and Exploiting, but I'm a programmer and everyday I'm learning something new. 

Right now I'm coding and learning on full Python, but I also code on C, C++, some JavaScript stuff, a little bit of Rust and I wanna learn that new Google's programming language, named Carbon. Also I'm learning Bash scripting for Linux shell, to colaborate in the GNU project and obviously, just going into something bigger. 

Hope u guys like my repo's, to make some pull requests, but obviously to build my ones. And finnally, I love helping people. There is my channel (soon in english too) to speak about life topics but in a different way. Thanks for reading this :))))))))))))
